# Assessment2Sunday
A Quiz/Fun Session to help Cohort 5.0 prepare for Assessment 2.

Hey Everyone!

I just want to preface this by saying it has been an absolute blast and honor being in this cohort with all of you.
Personally, I never knew I would ever be in a bootcamp or any program in which people who are working towards a professional
goal are all this welcoming and caring. I never knew I would care so deeply for a group of people who were strangers to me 4 
weeks ago. I never knew a group of people could be so willing to work so hard for a common goal, coming in nights and weekends
for 12 weeks straight. But what I know for a fact is that 5.0 is the best Cohort in this jawn and we're going to crush this 
assessment together. Let's get it.

## READMEs
Please read the READMEs for each section. They are listed below. I know I'm kinda garbage with writing md files so they are 
not as pretty as Leon's but hopefully they do the trick.
